# ‚ùÑ My quick `flake.nix`

For projects that I wanna quickly get started on, without being slowed down by the flake boilerplate.

## Copying

The code is MIT license, but I do not care if you use this in your projects.

## This is my personal stuff

Meaning, if you wanna tailor this flake to your need, fork or copy the code into your project. I will not be accepting
any issues or PRs unless they improve something. The only customer here is me.
